NoCoin
=========

NoCoin is an Android application created as a working proof of concept for cashless transactions where the buyer holds their phone up to seller's phone and the financial transaction occurs over NFC. 

This was coded in 24 hours for a hackathon. My teammates took care of the design and the backend (PHP).
