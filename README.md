NoCoin
=========

NoCoin is an Android application I coded in 24 hours for a hackathon. My teammates took care of the design and the backend (php).

It is a working proof of concept for cashless transactions whereby the buyer holds their phone up to seller's phone and the transaction occurs over NFC. Check out the code for a better idea of how the data is transferred.
